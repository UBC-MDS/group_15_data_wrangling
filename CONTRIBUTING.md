# Contributing to group_15_data_wrangling

Contributions of all kinds are welcome here, and they are greatly appreciated!
Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

*This CONTRIBUTING.md was adapted from the default Python minimal setup template.*

## Example Contributions

You can contribute in many ways, for example:

* [Report bugs](#report-bugs)
* [Fix Bugs](#fix-bugs)
* [Implement Features](#implement-features)
* [Write Documentation](#write-documentation)
* [Submit Feedback](#submit-feedback)

### Report Bugs

Report bugs at https://github.com/meirikson/group_15_data_wrangling/issues.

**If you are reporting a bug, please follow the template guidelines. The more
detailed your report, the easier and thus faster we can help you.**

### Fix Bugs

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything labelled with `bug` and
`help wanted` is open to whoever wants to implement it. When you decide to work on such
an issue, please assign yourself to it and add a comment that you'll be working on that,
too. If you see another issue without the `help wanted` label, just post a comment, the
maintainers are usually happy for any support that they can get.

### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything labelled with
`enhancement` and `help wanted` is open to whoever wants to implement it. As
for [fixing bugs](#fix-bugs), please assign yourself to the issue and add a comment that
you'll be working on that, too. If another enhancement catches your fancy, but it
doesn't have the `help wanted` label, just post a comment, the maintainers are usually
happy for any support that they can get.

### Write Documentation

group_15_data_wrangling could always use more documentation, whether as
part of the official documentation, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog
posts, articles, and such. Just
[open an issue](https://github.com/meirikson/group_15_data_wrangling/issues)
to let us know what you will be working on so that we can provide you with guidance.

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at
https://github.com/meirikson/group_15_data_wrangling/issues. If your feedback fits the format of one of
the issue templates, please use that. Remember that this is a volunteer-driven
project and everybody has limited time.

## GitHub Workflow for Team Contributions

For this project, our team follows the **GitHub Flow**:

1. **Create a branch** from `main` for each feature, function, or fix.  
   * Branch naming convention: `feature/<function_name>` or `fix/<issue_name>`

2. **Work on your branch locally**. Make commits regularly with meaningful messages.

3. **Push your branch** to GitHub:

   ```shell
   git push -u origin <branch_name>
   ```

4. **Create a pull request (PR)** to merge your branch into main.
   * Make sure to link the relevant issue if there is one.

5. **Another team member reviews the PR** and approves it.  
   * Provide constructive feedback if changes are needed.

6. Once approved, **merge the PR** into `main`.  
   * Use “Merge pull request”.

7. **Delete the branch** after merging to keep the repository clean.  
   * This avoids clutter in the repository and keeps `main` organized.
